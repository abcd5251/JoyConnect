# JoyConnect

We are building a decentralized AI content-sharing platform designed for sharing fun AI Avatars of your friends at live events such as ETH Global, inspired by the web2 application BeReal. Users first upload their own images to the platform. They can generate AI videos based on the templates they choose, which will create their own AI Avatar-style videos. After that, users can share these videos with all of their friends at these events. There will be a polling feature where users can like or dislike the videos they see. After voting, there will be a final leaderboard. The goal is to create fun and help people make more friends at live event.
We use a confidential ranking system to select the most entertaining content for each event.
At these events, participants can:
1.  Upload their photos to our secure platform
2. Select from engaging video templates
3. Watch as AI transforms their photos into personalized avatar videos
4. Share these creative videos with other event attendees
5. Engage through likes and dislikes
6. Compete for top spots on the event leaderboard
Our innovative AI Avatar generator provides fair and unbiased content discovery while maintaining a fun, engaging social atmosphere at live events. We believe by launching this app, people can make new friends more easily and find more joy in the events!

# Execution
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
